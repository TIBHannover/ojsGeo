In the upper right corner you can change the layers. You can choose between an \"OpenStreetMap\" layer and an \"Esri World Imagery\" layer. You can also set whether the geometric shape(s) and the administrative unit should be displayed or not. For the administrative unit you will find a more detailed description in the next paragraph (Coverage Information). Below the layer control you will find a search for the map. You can search for locations and by hitting \"Enter\" you will be offered different locations that match your input. By clicking on a suggestion it will be accepted and a matching rectangle, describing the boundaries of the location, will be displayed on the map. This rectangle can also be deleted/ edited by clicking on the trash-/ edit icon on the left side. In the lower right corner there is a scale (upper specification in kilometers, lower specification in miles)."

If you hover over the administrative unit(s) the superior hierarchy of administrative unit(s) is displayed if available. Besides you can add further administrative units. You are only able to insert a further administrative unit if it fits to the already given hierarchy of administrative unit(s), and the given geometric shape(s) in the map. If you begin to insert, there are some suggestions you can accept by clicking, but nevertheless you can input your own administrative unit by hitting \"Enter\". The administrative unit (in black) which is the lowest common denominator for all geometric shape(s) is shown in the map. The administrative unit is not editable or deletable in the map, but here via the input field.
